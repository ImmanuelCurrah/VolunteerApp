      <p>Hi, we are Immanuel, Kevin, and Laura. We wanted to create a centralized app for non profits to be able to post their events and find volunteers. In this app businesses can create a post to advertise their events and how many volunteers they need. Also, the VolunteerApp is a place where kind hearted people can look for events and activities where their volunteering is needed.</p>
